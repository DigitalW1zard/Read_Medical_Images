Explanation
Data Preparation:  `ImageDataGenerator` is used to rescale images and split data into training and validation sets.  `flow_from_directory` loads images from the specified directory, resizes them, and generates batches.
Model Building: A `Sequential` model is built with multiple `Conv2D` and `MaxPooling2D` layers for feature extraction.  `Flatten` layer converts 2D data to 1D. `Dense` layers are used for classification, with a `Dropout` layer to prevent overfitting.
3. Model Training: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.  `EarlyStopping` and `ModelCheckpoint` callbacks are used to stop training when validation loss stops improving and to save the best model.
4. Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated on a separate test set to determine its accuracy.
This is a simplified example and should be further refined with more data, hyperparameter tuning, and model optimization for a real-world application.
